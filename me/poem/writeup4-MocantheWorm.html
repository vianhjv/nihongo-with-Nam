                <span class="line">That afternoon, as Moca and I were walking to the library like we often do,</span>
                <span class="line">we saw a little earthworm crawling slowly across the hot asphalt road.</span>
                <span class="line">It looked dry and weary‚Äî</span>
                <span class="line">like it wouldn‚Äôt survive much longer under the sun.</span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-lines">
                <span class="line">Moca stopped right away and sat down beside it,</span>
                <span class="line">her face full of care and concern.</span>
                <span class="line">She said to me, ‚ÄúMommy, please carry the worm back to the soil.‚Äù</span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-lines">
                <span class="line">Before when we saw worms on roads,</span>
                <span class="line">Moca was too scared to touch worms,</span>
                <span class="line">even though she cares and she knows they are harmless</span>
                <span class="line">it is often me who bring the worms back to soil</span>
                <span class="line">But this time, I saw she showed worry and care for the safety of the worm</span>
                <span class="line">and I felt she be ready to do that herself.</span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-lines">
                <span class="line">So I told her,</span>
                <span class="line">‚ÄúYou can do it, baby. I‚Äôll wait right here.</span>
                <span class="line">You bring the worm back to it soft wet home.‚Äù</span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-lines">
                <span class="line">She hesitated,</span>
                <span class="line">She was still scared, she looked at me</span>
                <span class="line">again she pleaded me to do it instead.</span>
                <span class="line">I just looked in her eyes gently, encouraging.</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-lines">
                <span class="line">Then she tried to use a leaf to lift the worm,</span>
                <span class="line">but it slipped and fell.</span>
                <span class="line">Still, I stayed behind</span>
                <span class="line">I waited, watching, believed she would managed</span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-lines">
                <span class="line">She was scared, still she overcame her fear‚Äî</span>
                <span class="line">picked the worm up with her own hands,</span>
                <span class="line">and gently placed it back in soft, moist soil .</span>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-lines">
                <span class="line">That moment I felt a smile in my heart</span>
                <span class="line">when her care for the worm overcome the fear inside.</span>
                <span class="line">I stood there‚Äî</span>
                <span class="line">watching the seed of courage bloom,</span>
                <span class="line">silent and golden in her little heart.</span>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-lines">
                <span class="line">Then we continued the road to library</span>
                <span class="line">we met another creature‚Äîa caterpillar on the road:</span>
                <span class="line">a big, scary-looking caterpillar.</span>
                <span class="line">Its body was black, with red and green spots.</span>
                <span class="line">it looked creepy.</span>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-lines">
                <span class="line">I jumped ahead quickly‚Äî</span>
                <span class="line">I wanna leave it behind, did not want to have a look</span>
                <span class="line">Moca also screamed and hurried after me</span>
                <span class="line">But then‚Ä¶ she stopped...</span>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-lines">
                <span class="line">She turned around,</span>
                <span class="line">went back to the caterpillar,</span>
                <span class="line">and sat beside it.</span>

                <span class="line">Even though it looked scary to her,</span>
                <span class="line">she watched it carefully, unmoving</span>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-lines">
                <span class="line">Then she said to me,</span>
                <span class="line">‚ÄúMommy, if this caterpillar stays here in the middle of the road,</span>
                <span class="line">someone or bicycles might step on it,</span>
                <span class="line">It will die in great pain</span>
                <span class="line">I want to move it to the bushes.</span>
                <span class="line">Even if it‚Äôs going to die, at least it won‚Äôt suffer so much</span>

        <div class="verse">
            <div class="verse-lines">
                <span class="line">Her hands were trembling.</span>
                <span class="line">She used a leaf to try and scoop it up.</span>
                <span class="line">The caterpillar slipped</span>
                <span class="line">But this time, she stayed calm,</span>
                <span class="line">picked it up again with the leaf,</span>
                <span class="line">and placed it in the bushes.</span>

                <span class="line">‚ÄúMommy,</span>
                <span class="line">why do people cry so much when a person dies,</span>
                <span class="line">but they don‚Äôt cry when animals get hurt or die?</span>
